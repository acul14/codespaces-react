# The Beginner's Guide to React by Kent C. Dodds

Watch [The Beginner's Guide to React for free on egghead.io](https://kcd.im/beginner-react).

If you wish to play with the finished examples, you can do so in this repository. It's not required to learn from the course (these are not exercises).

To run the dev server, run the `start` file. If your operating system does not know how to run the "start" file, simply copy its contents into a command terminal to start the server.

The code in this directory is taken from https://github.com/kentcdodds/beginners-guide-to-react to enable working on and experimenting with the course's code without the need to install a development environment including node.js and friends. 

The `.devcontainer` configuration in this repository enables the use in [GitHub's CodeSpaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) as well as in local environments providing Docker and VS Code with the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).

While the contents of this directory do not need the whole React ecosystem installed in the `.devcontainer` configuration, it may serve well for further explorations of React.
